# AGENTS.md

Orientation for AI coding assistants working in this repo. Humans can read it too — it's also a useful onboarding cheat sheet.

## What this is

**GH Tasks** is a cross-platform menu-bar app that turns GitHub Issues and Projects v2 boards into a fast, keyboard-friendly task list. It lives in the macOS menu bar / Windows & Linux tray and pops open a compact window anchored to the tray icon.

- **Shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust backend + WebView frontend), menu-bar-only (no Dock icon on macOS)
- **Frontend:** Svelte 5 (runes: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Rust, `reqwest` for HTTP, `keyring` for token storage
- **Auth:** GitHub OAuth **device flow** (no client secret, no backend server)
- **Data:** GitHub GraphQL (Projects v2) + GitHub REST (issue search, comments)

## Identifiers & secrets

- **Bundle identifier:** `com.cgaspard.ghtasks` (legacy `dev.ghtasks.app` is auto-migrated)
- **Keychain service name:** same as bundle identifier
- **OAuth scopes:** `repo read:user read:org notifications project`
- **Client ID:** `GHTASKS_CLIENT_ID` — embedded at build time via `option_env!`; runtime override via env var for dev
- **Apple signing secrets** (GitHub repo secrets, used by `release.yml`):
  - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (base64 p12 — must contain **only** the Developer ID Application cert + its matching private key, otherwise `security import` picks the wrong one)
  - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
  - `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` (e.g. `Developer ID Application: Corey Gaspard (WT7J44YVA3)`)
  - `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (app-specific password), `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Never log or commit these. Don't regenerate the p12 from the local Keychain without re-exporting only the Developer ID cert.

## Running locally

```bash
# One-time
npm install
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin   # macOS only, for universal

# Dev (runs Vite + Tauri with hot reload)
npm run tauri dev

# Or use the VS Code launcher "Tauri Dev"
```

`GHTASKS_CLIENT_ID` must be set at build time. A `.env` file at the repo root with `GHTASKS_CLIENT_ID=Ov23lihPJQFjJ3eZd0Zc` works for local dev.

## Code conventions

- **TypeScript:** strict mode. Prefer `$derived` over recomputed assignments. Named exports only.
- **Rust:** clippy-clean on `cargo clippy --all-targets`. Wrap all GitHub HTTP calls in `http_log::send_timed` so timings show up in logs.
- **GraphQL queries:** keep them inline in the relevant Rust module as `const … : &str`. Avoid `orderBy:` on `projectsV2` connections — it has silently null'd the `organizations` branch for certain org roles; sort client-side instead.
- **Stores:** anything the user would expect to persist across relaunches should use `persistent()` from `lib/persistentStore.ts`. Transient UI state stays in plain `writable()`.
- **CSP:** `tauri.conf.json` → `security.csp`. If a Tauri plugin's IPC is blocked, add `ipc:` / `http://ipc.localhost` to `connect-src` (not `default-src`).
- **No trailing summaries in responses.** Terse over verbose. Don't restate what a well-named symbol already says.
- **No premature abstractions.** Three similar lines beat a bad base class.

## The refresh loop (important mental model)

`App.svelte::refresh()` is the heartbeat:

1. Bumps `refreshGeneration`. Any late-arriving data (streamed project pages) tagged with a stale generation is dropped.
2. In parallel:
   - `api.fetchAll()` — REST issue-search for all enabled repo sources, returns all results at once
   - `api.fetchAllProjectsStreaming()` — fires `project-page` events as each GraphQL page lands; `App.svelte` reconciles them into `$projectResults`
3. Reconciliation is additive: items are upserted by `item_id`. On the **final** page of a generation, items not seen this generation are dropped (archived/removed upstream), except those in the `recentlyCreated` buffer (2-min TTL) — GitHub Search and Projects indexing lags ~60s behind creates, so we keep recently-created issues visible until the server catches up.
4. Results are persisted to `localStorage` via `persistent()` so the next cold launch paints instantly from cache while a fresh sync runs underneath.

Auto-poll every 90s. Manual refresh via the ↻ button in TopBar.

## Performance notes (earned, not guessed)

- Current full-snapshot fetch of a 500-item board: ~4s on refresh, ~8.6s cold.
- Key wins: server-side `-status:Released` default filter, disk-cache hydrate, parallel-cursor pagination on subsequent refreshes.
- REST + ETag optimization was researched and rejected: REST `projects/.../items?fields=` needs numeric field IDs that don't map cheaply from our GraphQL `id`s, and we'd have to maintain two parallel shape representations. Don't revive it without a concrete benchmark.

## Common diagnostics

- **"I can't see project X":** Open avatar menu → **Developer Tools** → Console. Click `+ Project`. Look for `[ghtasks] list_projects returned N project(s)` and the array. If `0` or missing an expected project, it's almost always: (1) org hasn't approved the OAuth app, (2) SSO not authorized for the token, or (3) stale token from before `read:org` was added — sign out + sign in fixes the last.
- **Notifications silent:** Check for CSP violations on `ipc:` in the console — `tauri.conf.json` must whitelist `ipc:` + `http://ipc.localhost` in `connect-src`.
- **Issue "disappeared" right after creating it:** Expected for ~60s; the `recentlyCreated` buffer re-injects it. If it persists beyond 2 min, something else is wrong — check the refresh logs.

## Release Process

Releases are driven entirely by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag. The workflow at [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds signed/notarized artifacts for macOS / Windows / Linux and attaches them to a **draft** GitHub release, using the body pulled from `release_notes/<tag>.md`.

### Per-version release notes (required)

Every tag **must** have a matching `release_notes/<tag>.md` file, or the build fails in the `preflight` job before any compile work starts. This is intentional — it means the release body is version-controlled, reviewable in PRs, and available for historical reference long after the release ships.

- File path: `release_notes/vX.Y.Z.md`
- Contents: markdown. Section headers like `### Fixes`, `### New`, `### Install` are conventional but not required.
- Must be non-empty.

### Cutting a release (step by step)

1. **Pick the version.** Semver. Bump patch for fixes, minor for features.
2. **Write the release notes.** Create `release_notes/vX.Y.Z.md`. Describe changes in user-visible terms — "why would someone care?" not "what files changed." Cover fixes, new features, known issues, and install/upgrade instructions.
3. **Bump versions in code:**
   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `version`
   - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` → `[package] version`
   - `package.json` → `version`
4. **Commit.** Conventional subject, e.g. `Release v0.1.9 — notification CSP + empty-state CTAs`.
5. **Tag and push:**
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin main --tags
   ```
6. **Watch the workflow.** `gh run watch` or GitHub Actions UI. On success you'll have a draft release with:
   - `GH.Tasks_universal.dmg` (signed + notarized)
   - `GH.Tasks_x64-setup.exe`, `GH.Tasks_x64_en-US.msi`
   - `GH.Tasks_amd64.AppImage`, `GH.Tasks_amd64.deb`, `GH.Tasks-<v>-1.x86_64.rpm`
7. **Spot-check the artifacts.** Download the DMG and install on a fresh machine or VM; verify no Gatekeeper warning, sign-in works, projects load.
8. **Publish the draft** via `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --repo cgaspard/ghtasks --draft=false` or the web UI. Drafts don't notify watchers; publishing does.

### If something goes wrong

- **`preflight` job fails with "Missing release notes":** you forgot `release_notes/<tag>.md`. Add the file, commit, delete the tag locally and remotely, re-tag, push.
- **macOS signing fails with `security import: failed to import keychain certificate`:** the p12 likely contains multiple certs. Re-export just the **Developer ID Application** cert + its matching private key from Keychain as a fresh p12 and update the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` secret.
- **Workflow runs for 0s and shows "startup_failure":** check that step-level `if:` expressions don't reference `secrets.*` directly (they're not available there). Use the job-level `env.HAS_APPLE_CERT` pattern.
- **Release has wrong notes:** edit `release_notes/vX.Y.Z.md` in main, then `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file release_notes/vX.Y.Z.md`. (The build-time copy is a snapshot; the file is the source of truth.)

### Never

- Never push a tag that doesn't have a `release_notes/<tag>.md` (the preflight will block you, but don't rely on it — if someone disables the check, the release body falls back to nothing).
- Never force-push to `main`. Never force-delete a published release's tag — it breaks `Sparkle`/auto-update semantics if we ever add them.
- Never commit `.env`, `*.p12`, or any file that contains `APPLE_*` or `GHTASKS_CLIENT_ID` values. `.gitignore` covers the common ones; double-check before `git add`.

## Things agents commonly get wrong here

- **Inventing comments.** Don't explain what `const myLogin = $derived($auth.user?.login ?? "")` does — it's self-explanatory. Save comments for the non-obvious *why*.
- **Adding backwards-compat shims.** We ship a menu-bar app, not a library. If a type or function is unused after a change, delete it.
- **Adding `orderBy: {field: TITLE}` to `projectsV2` GraphQL queries.** Don't. See conventions above.
- **Using native `<select>`.** Use the themed `Select.svelte` component. It exists for good reason.
- **Skipping the release notes file** "since the build will just generate something." It won't anymore — preflight will fail.
